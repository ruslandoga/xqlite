- named binds, e.g.: XQLite.bind_number(db, stmt, "id", 30)
- optimise small ints
- optimise make_cell more
- improve error handling
- maybe start tx automatically in XQlite.insert_all
- expose more C api (columns, changes, last insert rowid, release memory, load_extensions, expanded/normalized sql, wal, stats (scan status), etc.)
- on close, use sqlite3_next_stmt to finalize all prepared statements?
- check what happens when insert_all's prepared statement is executed after schema change
- check what happens interrupt is called between steps in fetch all
