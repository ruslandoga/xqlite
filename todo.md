- optimise small ints and maybe use something other than SQLITE_TRANSIENT in binaries (when its safe)
- optimise make_cell more
- improve error handling
- maybe start tx automatically in XQlite.insert_all
- expose more C api (release memory, load_extensions, normalized sql, wal, stats (scan status), etc.)
- on close, use sqlite3_next_stmt to finalize all prepared statements? needs to avoid double free, e.g. by extending stmt_t with extra info
- check what happens when insert_all's prepared statement is executed after schema change
- check what happens interrupt is called between steps in fetch all
- rollback if raises during tx? probably not, seems like an app concern, can be done in xqlite_writer / xqlite_ecto
